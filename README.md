**Description**: `[Poker Agents is a mash-up of Indian Poker with a twist Russian Roulette played in Augmented Reality (AR). It is a game of bluffing and deception for up to 2 players in Shared AR. Like Indian Poker, each player is assigned a number that they will never be able to know. However the player can still see other player's numbers in AR. The players then have to use their skills in deduction, bluffing and reasoning to get as much info as they can from the opponent to decide on how to get ahead or survive. The rules of the game is simple: To win this game, you need to be the first player to acquire 3 scores. Based on their assigned invisible number, If the player is assigned the higher number than their opponent, the player will be able to kill the opponent and gain scores. However, if the player who fired the gun has a lower assigned number than the opponent, the player gets a score deduction. The twist and fun factor of this game is that players then have to decide whether to pick up a gun (in AR) to shoot the opponent to gain scores or risking score deduction, or allow the opponent to take the risk of gaining a score by allowing the opponent to shoot the player instead. Like all popular tabletop games - Laughters, cunningness and friendships affected is guaranteed!]` <br>
